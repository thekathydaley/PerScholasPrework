	<p class="Header1">My education</p>
		<p id="Body4">I discontinued my formal education in the 10th grade and got my GED when I was 18. I was very unhappy with having to take that path but it's what my life required at the time. At 26 years old, I decided to push myself and see what I could do so I started at Clayton State in 2012 and graduated with my Bachelor's in English in 2016 while working full time, taking care of four kids, and pregnant with my youngest son....it didn't end there. I went on to get my Master's in Liberal Arts - English in 2019 as well.</p>
	<p class="Header1">My kids</p>
		<p id="Body2">Between my husband and I, we have seven not-so-small humans. When we got together, he had two children and I had four. We collectively had four daughters and two sons and yet this crazy man wanted to see what a little "us" would look like so we negotiated one more tiny human to round out our family. In order of age we have: Skylar who is 18, Rylee is 17, Zaylen is 14, Kimora is 12, Kimani is 11, Kolby is 10, and our smallest human, Jackson is 4. We will be parenting teenagers until we're almost 50. We literally don't have to invite anyone to our parties nor do we have to pick up extra players if we want to have a quick game of basically any sport.</p>
	<p class="Header1">My favorite places to walk</p>
		<p id="Body3">When you combine free stuff and nature, I am always happy. I love walking trails and here are a couple of my favorites! The easiest answer for me is the park near my house: JP Moseley. This park is very convenient but it is also over 2 miles long and has a beautiful stream just off of the path. One of my other favorites is High Falls. This one has beautiful waterfalls and has so many options for hiking. It's beautiful, peaceful, and allows you to spend as much time as you please without getting bored. Walking is the easiest and most enjoyable of exercise options and the trails make it even better! </p>
